# rust-book

This repository is for keeping track of my progress with the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) book.

The official [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) consists of 20 chapters.

# Executing a program

The root directory is a `workspace`, containing seperate Cargo crates.

In the root directory, run `cargo build`.

When Cargo is done compiling and building, run `cargo run --bin chapter<:id>`.

For example: `cargo run --bin chapter01`.
